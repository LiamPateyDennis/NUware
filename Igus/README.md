Igus Model Files
=================

## Description
3D model files of the Igus robot modified to suit the needs of the NUbots team. [Original files](https://github.com/igusGmbH/HumanoidOpenPlatform) obtained from University of Bonn and igus&reg; GmbH.

## List of changes to date
	* Shin, thigh, upper arm, and lower arm segments were split in half down their length, to accomodate printing on FDM style printers. Added a tongue and groove around the joins (to bring the two halves back together), and further ribbing to the insides of these parts to increase strength, along with a small bar through the center to bolt the two sides together.
	* Torso was split in half horizontally. 
	* Handle on back was scooped out and made into a separate part. 
	* Removable panels put into the top of the shoulders to allow easier access to the shoulder servos.
	* Moved the button and LED board to the back bottom panel on the torso to bring it closer to the CM730. This is fixed with screws it into the panel to support it better
	* Added a strengthening bar between the should and neck servos (inside the torso) to reduce flexibility in the chest
	* Added a small plug to upper front torso with the nuclear/radiation/bio hazard symbol
	* The head was split into more pieces. Added some more ribbing to the insides of the head. Also made some modifications to the camera mounts
	* Added cable routes to toe covers
